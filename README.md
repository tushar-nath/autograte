# Autograte

Autograte is an innovative tool designed to bridge the gap between Express.js route changes and Prisma database migrations. It automates the process of generating Prisma migration files by analyzing modifications in Express routes.

## Key Features

1. **Route Analysis:** Scans Express.js route definitions for changes.
2. **Schema Inference:** Deduces potential database schema changes based on route modifications.
3. **Migration Generation:** Automatically creates Prisma migration files.
4. **Consistency Checking:** Ensures alignment between API endpoints and database schema.
5. **Customization Options:** Allows developers to fine-tune the migration generation process.

## Functionality

1. The tool monitors Express.js route files for changes.
2. When a change is detected, it analyzes the new or modified routes.
3. Based on the route analysis, it infers potential changes needed in the database schema.
4. It generates Prisma migration files that reflect these inferred changes.
5. Developers can review and adjust the generated migrations before applying them.

## Uniqueness

1. **Automatic Inference:** Unlike traditional migration tools, it doesn't require manual schema definition.
2. **API-Driven:** Derives database changes from API endpoints, ensuring API-database consistency.
3. **Prisma Integration:** Seamlessly works with Prisma, leveraging its powerful migration capabilities.
4. **Express.js Specific:** Tailored for Express.js, understanding its routing patterns and conventions.
5. **Proactive Approach:** Suggests schema changes based on API changes, rather than reacting to manual schema modifications.

## Benefits

1. **Time-Saving:** Reduces the manual effort required in writing migration files.
2. **Error Reduction:** Minimizes human errors in translating API changes to database schema changes.
3. **Consistency:** Ensures that the database schema always reflects the current state of the API.
4. **Developer Experience:** Streamlines the workflow between API development and database management.
